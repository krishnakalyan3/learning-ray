```
In this interview, you’ll talk with one of our Member of Technical Staff, Field Eng and undergo a live coding exercise. You’ll be asked to write a single-threaded algorithm and discuss how to scale it (with Ray). You should come prepared knowing Ray Core fundamentals and be familiar with Ray’s Python interface. We don’t expect you to have the APIs memorized–our engineer will help you along the way. However you should understand the fundamentals and some Ray best practices.
